# TODO 

1. ~~ The token is pulled from .env during build time. User should be able to set it in the `<c2c-widget>` tag.~~
2. ~~`<style>` is included within DOM elements as they come and go.
    They should however be injected to shadow DOM root `shadowRoot.appendChild(style);`. Perhaps a global StyleManager class
    that can be used to inject styles into the shadow DOM.~~
3. The widget should be able to be used in a non-modal form. Perhaps a modal wrapper that's decoupled from the widget.
    ```html
    <!-- modal usage -->
    <c2c-modal trigger="callButton">
        <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton>"</c2c-widget>
    </c2c-modal>

    <!-- non-modal usage -->
    <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton></c2c-widget>
    ```
4. which device is selected? mute/unmute ... and other device based things.
