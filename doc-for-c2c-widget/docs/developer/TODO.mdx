# TODO

1. ~~The token is pulled from .env during build time. User should be able to set it in the `<c2c-widget>` tag.~~
2. ~~`<style>` is included within DOM elements as they come and go.
    They should however be injected to shadow DOM root `shadowRoot.appendChild(style);`. Perhaps a global StyleManager class
    that can be used to inject styles into the shadow DOM.~~
3. The widget should be able to be used in a non-modal form. Perhaps a modal wrapper that's decoupled from the widget.
    ```html
    <!-- modal usage -->
    <c2c-modal trigger="callButton">
        <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton>"</c2c-widget>
    </c2c-modal>

    <!-- non-modal usage -->
    <c2c-widget callStartTrigger="callButton></c2c-widget>
    ```
4. ~~which device is selected?~~ mute/unmute ... and other device based things.

1. on mobile, user's video is not showing. 
2. on mobile, loading spinner is not centered vertically.
3. ~~on mobile, the drop-down for device selection is offset from buttons.~~
4. Handle errors properly. This includes device errors, connection errors and errors from the Client.

1. `<c2c-widget>`'s `callDetails` shouldn't be an stringified JSON? It should just be 3 attributes. Why would you ever pass a JSON string?
2. on desktop safari, the user video is centered. This seems related to the user video stream not showing up on mobile.
3. on mobile safari ,the up arrow is very scaled down
4. ~~textcontent replaces even the svg tail (?) in chat bubbles for some reason~~
5. clean up stuff correctly on hangup, so the next load is fresh.
