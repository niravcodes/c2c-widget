# How to update the widget

Clone the repo, `npm install` in the `embed-script` folder, and `npm run build` to make sure the widget builds. 
Then:

1. Make changes in the `embed-script` folder.
2. test your changes in the dev server (`npm run dev`)
3. Run `npm run build` to build the widget.
4. Run `npm run pushToCDN` to push the widget to the swrooms temporary CDN.

:::warning
if you want to push to the swrooms CDN, you need to have credentials to swrooms.

If you don't have the creds, simply put the `dist/widget.js` file wherever you want.
