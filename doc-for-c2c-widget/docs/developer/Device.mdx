# Device management

The logic for device management is handled in the `Devices` class. This class
uses `@signalwire/webrtc` to enumerate devices and switch between them.

The UI for device management is handled in the `controls.ui.ts` file. It creates new
`DeviceMenu` objects when user clicks the device menu button.
