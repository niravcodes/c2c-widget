# Usage

Vite builds the widget into a single js file at location `dist/widget.js`.

To use the widget, you need to include the js file in your project.

As an example inclusion, consider the following html fragment:

```html
<!-- place and style this button arbitrarily, but it's id should match the buttonId in the c2c-widget tag below -->
<button
  id="callButton"
  style="
        position: fixed;
        height: 70px;
        width: 70px;
        bottom: 50px;
        right: 50px;
      "
>
  Call
</button>

<c2c-widget
  buttonId="callButton"
  callDetails='{"destination":"/private/demo-1","supportsVideo":true,"supportsAudio":true}'
></c2c-widget>

<script src="/widget.js"></script>
<!-- end code required to initialize c2c widget -->
```
